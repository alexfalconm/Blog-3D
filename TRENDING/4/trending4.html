            <p>At Odds is the very first illustration I made for Star Wars back in 2016. Despite having shared the image on here <br>
                before as well as on my website, I just realized that I had not written anything about it. Which is a shame! There <br>
                is a story about this illustration, and not everyone knows it. Well, a part from the millions who watched the Clone <br>
                Wars of course. But I wasn’t one of them when I was asked to work on At Odds, so I thought it I was part of some <br>
                well kept secret when I read the brief. The brief in question read something along the lines of “Aging Obi-Wan <br>
                Kenobi battles Darth Maul on the sands of Tatooine”. After a brief externalization of puzzlement, I wrote to my Art <br>
                Director at Fantasy Flight Games explaining to him that there must have been a mistake, as Darth Maul had already <br>
                been killed by Obi-Wan on Naboo. I mean, come on.</p>
