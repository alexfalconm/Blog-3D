            <p>This high poly of a scope is a #WIP by Ryzin’s Dan Kenton. A friend of his, who is a concept artist, wanted to send him <br>
                something that would be great practice for them both. Dan then turned his concept into a game-ready piece.
                Dan says <br>
                 “the most enjoyable part was being able to import his sculpt to use as direct reference. It makes the modeling process <br>
                  go by much quicker just being able to have the concept in 3D in the same scene. The most challenging aspect was <br>
                   getting proper topology. As the original concept was sculpted in Zbrush, it can sometimes be hard to replicate different <br>
                    form changes and such in poly modeling. The next stage of the process would be to perfect this high poly model. As it <br>
                     stands right now, some of the edges are a bit too soft and it has some shading errors in places. The next step also includes <br>
                      deciding what materials I will want to assign during the texturing phase, as this will decide edge widths in the high poly.” <br>
